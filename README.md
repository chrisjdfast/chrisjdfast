## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Chris, and I'm mostly a Blender user doing 3D and VFX, but I want to learn how to code with python to make some addons. That's why I'm here! 
So far I've made a [lensflare nodegroup](https://chrisfast.gumroad.com/l/easy-lens-flares) for the compositor.
I also have a super part time [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@chrisfastmedia).
